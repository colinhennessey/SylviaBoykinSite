    <h1>Statement To The Police</h1>
    <p>
      Two hours after leaving Mrs. Pope’s residence on that same day in May 1992, Sylvia was arrested. She was then questioned by 
      Detective Dennis Dusak of the Philadelphia Police Department’s Homicide Unit. Detective Dusak claims that Sylvia waived her 
      Miranda rights to legal representation at the beginning of this interrogation. Sylvia says that Detective Dusak kept her 
      handcuffed to a chair for hours. Dusak hit her while she was handcuffed to the chair. He then coerced her to sign the statement 
      he made up. Dusak told her that if she did not sign the statement she could never see her three daughters again; he instead 
      promised that if she signed the statement she could go home to them. Sylvia had been handcuffed to a chair for hours and was 
      increasingly concerned about her three young daughters. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Detective Dennis Dusak capitalized on Sylvia’s unique vulnerability as a single mother with three children to convince her to 
      sign a fabricated statement that would incriminate it, allowing him to have a conviction for a serious crime. By using his power 
      as a state official to coerce Sylvia, he acted as yet another contributor to the consistent state violence used against women of 
      color. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Sylvia’s codefendant, Aaron Major, who is currently incarcerated, has and continues to say that his statement was 
      coerced as well. He said before the court that he was beat by police officers until he signed a statement that implicated all 
      three codefendants in the crime. Sylvia still remembers hearing the sounds of Major getting beaten from the investigation room 
      next door. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia Boykin’s and Aaron Major’s experiences are unfortunately not unusual behavior by Detective Dennis Dusak and the 
      Philadelphia Police Department’s Homicide Unit. The City of Philadelphia has paid $13 million for unconstitutional investigations 
      that resulted in wrongful convictions in which Detective Dennis Dusak was the lead investigative detective. In both, Detective 
      Dennis Dusak and the Homicide Unit fabricated statements, used verbal and physical threats to force a signature on those 
      statements, misrepresented information, failed to properly investigate all suspects, and produced fictitious probable cause 
      affidavits (<a href='https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/17D0036P.pdf'>Wright v. the City of Philadelphia, et al. 16-5020</a> and 
      <a href='https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/17D0451P.pdf'>Gilyard, et al. v. Dusak, et al. 16-2986</a>). Detective Dusak and the 
      Philadelphia Police Department’s Homicide Unit have habits of using these tactics to obtain a quick and easy conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Sylvia and Major have disagreed with their coerced, incriminating statements since the initial trial. They both have 
      continued to testify under oath from the court that their statements were coerced and not reflective of the truth. Rather, 
      they testify that Albert Sutton, Ms. Pope’s son, pulled out a gun and approached them when Sylvia asked Ms. Pope to pay her 
      debts. Their third codefendant corroborates this testimony. However, the prosecution relied heavily on Detective Dusak’s 
      statement and testimony during trial. The coerced statement and Detective Dusak’s testimony, despite their blatant disregard for 
      justice, overshadows their testimonies. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia recently filed a Petition under the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA) about Detective Dennis Dusak’s 
      violation of her constitutional rights and freedoms. Though she has a court date in April 2020, she has not received any contact 
      from her court-appointed lawyer and fears he/she/they will be unprepared for court.
