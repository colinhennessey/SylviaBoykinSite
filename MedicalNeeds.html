    <p>
      Sylvia, at age 61, is declining in health. She is struggling with sciatica nerve damage, arthritis, and herniated discs, all of which make her live with regular pain. She 
      has been recovering from an emergency bowel surgery for a couple of months and is now waiting to receive spinal surgery. In addition, she is going through various tests to 
      check for cancer. She requires a lot of extra accommodations from the prison. It is neither a healthy or comfortable environment for her healing; rather,

      it is facilitating her health decline even faster</a>. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the close living conditions of prison, bear an 
      immense threat to Sylviaâ€™s health.

      Throughout all of this, Sylvia continues to take care of older women who are incarcerated and struggling medically, as well as other women working to improve their mental 
      health. In addition, she does her best to take care of her family, particularly her daughters who are struggling with their physical and mental health. In their time of 
      pain and suffering, Sylvia and her family wish more than ever to see justice restored so they can take care of one another.
