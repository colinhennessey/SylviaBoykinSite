      <h1>Sylvia Boykin</h1>
      <p>
        Sylvia Boykin, age 61, is a mother of three, a grandmother of seven, an enthusiastic member of her church community, and a certified Mental Health Peer Specialist at SCI
        Muncy. She serves as an Inside Advisor to the Philadelphia Justice Project for Women & Girls. Sylvia has done an incredible amount of work to improve her mental health, 
        particularly through the programs and groups made available to her during her time incarcerated at Muncy State Correctional Institution in Muncy, Pennsylvania. 
      </p>

        To date, Sylvia has served nearly three decades of a life without parole sentence. Together with two male codefendants, Sylvia was charged and subsequently convicted 
        of first-degree murder following a shoot-out over a drug transaction. Although accounts of the crime vary, prosecution and defense witnesses all agree that Sylvia was
        unarmed and did not shoot the victim in the case, Bernetta Pope. At the time of the trial and in the decades that followed, each of her codefendants stated that Sylvia
        was not the shooter and did not participate in or conspire to commit a murder. One of her codefendants had his sentence vacated and was released 
        from prison in 1998, while Sylvia and another codefendant—Aaron Major—remain. Unjust practices in the collection of her testimony, her trial, and her subsequent legal 
        representation have contributed to her stay in prison, have violated her constitutional rights and freedoms, have harmed her 
        <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/local/20110624_Forum_focuses_on_children_with_parents_in_prison.html">relationship with her daughters</a> and grandchildren, 
        and have made it hard for her to get the medical care she needs. Sylvia is currently awaiting a hearing for the Petition she filed under the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction 
        Release Act (scheduled for April 2020). She filed an application for commutation in April of 2019 and has not received any updates. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Sylvia has consistently utilized her in time in prison to make amends for the harms of her crimes. She has successfully participated in a wide variety of rehabilitation,
        education, and vocational training programs as well as mental health treatment. She enjoys the support of a robust circle of family and friends and is committed to doing
        everything she can to make positive contributions to her family, church, and community.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe Sylvia Boykin is a highly deserving candidate for commutation of sentence. Her application is currently before the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons. She is scheduled
        for Merit Review in October 2022.
